If the end of social bookmarking site Delicious last year taught you anything, it should be that you need to manage your own bookmarks. And now you can, with WordPress. 

Treasure Island is a WordPress theme that makes managing bookmarks easy. 

**Get Started**

Getting started with Treasure Island is simple: just create a new subdomain on your server (my-awesome-bookmarks.example.com), install WordPress, and set Treasure Island as your theme.
