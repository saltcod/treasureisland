If the end of social bookmarking site Delicious last year taught you anything, it should be that you need to manage your own bookmarks. And now you can, with WordPress. 

Treasure Island is a WordPress theme that makes managing bookmarks easy. It makes bookmarks taggable, categorizable and searchable. Best of all, Treasure Island can be just for youâ€”if you don't ever tell anyone what domain name you're using, no one will ever know. Treasure Island is delightfully antisocial.

**Get Started**

Getting started with Treasure Island is simple: just create a new subdomain on your server (my-awesome-bookmarks.example.com), install WordPress, and set Treasure Island as your theme.
